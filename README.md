Multi-Class Classification â€” OvR vs OvO (Logistic Regression)

This project demonstrates a multi-class classification pipeline that compares One-vs-Rest (OvR) and One-vs-One (OvO) logistic regression strategies.
It provides an easy way to evaluate and visualize which approach delivers higher accuracy and more robust performance.


ðŸ§° Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

NumPy, Pandas â€“ data processing

scikit-learn â€“ LogisticRegression, OneVsRestClassifier, OneVsOneClassifier, cross-validation

Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ visualization

Jupyter Notebook â€“ interactive workflow


ðŸ¤– Why Machine Learning?

Traditional rule-based methods or manual analysis often fail when dealing with multi-class problems because:

They require manual feature engineering for each class.

They do not scale well when the number of categories grows.

Accuracy heavily depends on human-defined rules, which may be biased or incomplete.

By applying Machine Learning in this project, we gain:

Scalability â†’ OvR and OvO strategies allow classification across many classes without rewriting rules.

Automation â†’ feature importance is learned directly from data rather than hand-designed.

Performance-driven insights â†’ cross-validation provides objective accuracy and F1 comparisons, showing which strategy is better supported by the data.

Reusability â†’ once trained, the model can be applied to new datasets instantly with minimal changes.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: ML transforms the classification problem into a repeatable, data-driven, and adaptive process, ensuring that the best approach (OvR vs. OvO) can be identified quickly and applied to real-world scenarios.


ðŸ“Š Feature Importance

The notebook also includes a feature importance analysis by averaging absolute coefficients across classifiers
By this project, the top 3 features that will effect Obesesity level are --> weight, gender, height


ðŸ”„ Pipeline & Reusability

By building the model inside a scikit-learn Pipeline, this project ensures that the workflow is:

Reproducible â†’ preprocessing (e.g., scaling) and model training are bundled together.

Reusable â†’ anyone can run the model with minimal setup.

Plug-and-Play â†’ just provide a data path, and the pipeline handles cleaning, scaling, training, and evaluation automatically.
